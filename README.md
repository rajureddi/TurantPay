 ## **TurantPay: App for Offline UPI Payments**

**TurantPay** is a modern Android utility designed to bridge the gap between digital payments and offline accessibility. It provides a professional Graphical User Interface (GUI) over the official *99# USSD framework provided by NPCI, making offline banking as easy as a smartphone app.

### **📲 How It Works**

TurantPay automates the manual entry usually required for *99#. Instead of typing `*99*1*1#`, the app uses Android's `Intent.ACTION_CALL` to dial the precisely formatted string based on your UI interaction or QR scan.
---
### **🛡️ Security & Privacy**

* **No PIN Storage:** The app never asks for or stores your UPI PIN. PIN entry happens on the official secure system dialer.
* **Data Localism:** All transaction logs are stored locally on your device.
* **Official Gateway:** TurantPay acts as a bridge to the official NPCI gateway; we do not process the money ourselves.
